# Kaggle Competition - Fake or Real News
We will use a dataset of 1298 "fake news" headlines (which mostly include headlines of articles
classied as biased, etc.) and 1968 \real" news headlines, where the "fake news" headlines
are from https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news/data and "real news" headlines are
from https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines. The data were cleaned by
removing words from fake news titles that are not a part of the headline, removing special
characters from the headlines, and restricting real news headlines to those after October
2016 containing the word "trump". For your interest, the cleaning script is available as
clean_script.py on the course web page, but you do not need to run it.
