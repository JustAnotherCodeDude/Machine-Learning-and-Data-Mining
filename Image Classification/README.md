# Testing on the famous 8X8 grey scale digit dataset
For this question you will build classiers to
label images of handwritten digits. Each image is 8 by 8 pixels and is represented as a vector
of dimension 64 by listing all the pixel values in raster scan order. The images are grayscale
and the pixel values are between 0 and 1. The labels y are 0; 1; 2; ... ; 9 corresponding to
which character was written in the image. There are 700 training cases and 400 test cases for
each digit; they can be found in a2digits.zip.
